A buddy gifted me this Commodore 64 and a big stack of accompanying floppy disks. This seemed like a great computer to start with. Unsurprisingly, given that it was was the best-selling personal computer of all time, there's a big, friendly, welcoming scene of people restoring them and modding them today. I've gotten tons of helpful pointers from folks in person and on Twitter. It's easy to find parts, and there are some nifty new mods being produced. This is going to be my first attempted restoration. I'm uncertain about how retrobriting will go in gloomy Seattle, and I haven't done serious soldering since middle school. If I mess something up too badly, it'll probably be straightforward enough to replace whatever I break. ðŸ¤ž

It's a [Commodore 64c](https://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&c=998), which was the famous "breadbin" C64 repackaged into a slimmer case that matched the style of Commodore's next generation of computers. But... the more I look at this, a few things seem off. The keyboard is the wrong color: the [breadbin C64s](https://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?c=98) had these dark brown keys, and I can't find records of any C64c model that used them. The case also doesn't snap closed in the front.

Inside, it has the original "long" style motherboard. All the screws were removed, and everything is just sitting loose in the case. It looks like somebody put some sort of white stuff (thermal paste?) on some of the chips. 

I wonder if this is actually a breadbin C64 that somebody removed from its original case and put into a C64c case. I found an ivory-colored keyboard on ebay, so I'll be able to fix the appearance, but I don't think I'll be able to get the case to close.

 With a [new power supply](https://www.keelog.com/power-supply/) and [RCA video cable](https://the-neo-retro.com/shop/ols/products/commodore-64128-6-foot-8-pin-to-rca-chromaluma-connection), it boots to BASIC! There's an unpleasant buzzing sound I'd like to figure out.

  For the restoration, I got replacement capacitors, screws, and a fuse courtesy of [Retroleum](https://retroleum.co.uk/). And then for fun, I got an [Epyx FastLoad Reloaded](https://www.thefuturewas8bit.com/shop/commodore/eflr.html) cartridge, an [SD2IEC](https://hackaday.io/project/171759-c64-sd2iec-lp) to load disk images, and a [64NIC+](https://www.go4retro.com/products/64nic/) network card.
