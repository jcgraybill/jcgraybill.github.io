### Multi Pong

Dust off your old Quadra and relive computer gaming circa 1992 with Multi Pong! A tiny little 68K Macintosh System 7 game built in 2022. It plays like pong, except that you move windows around rather than directly controlling a paddle.

Built as part of the [68k programming study group](https://tinkerdifferent.com/threads/idea-macintosh-68k-programming-study-group.1681/) on [Tinker Different](https://tinkerdifferent.com/). [Get it here](https://github.com/jcgraybill/multipong/releases).

Playable on the web courtesy of [this web browser port](https://github.com/jsdf/macemu) of the Basilisk II Macintosh emulator.
