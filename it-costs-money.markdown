This is *it costs money to be alive*. While learning [Go](https://golang.org/), I was looking for some variety from the [usual](https://adventofcode.com/) [exercises](https://amazon.com/dp/1680501224) I use to learn a new language. I decided to make a small game, looked around for a moderately-priced tileset that inspired me, and used the [ebiten](https://ebiten.org/) 2D game library. All the levels are .csv files and live-reload in the game engine, so it's easy to add new content using (of all things) Microsoft Excel.

There's not much to the game. I didn't want to build something about guns and fighting. You run to the end of the level, picking up as many coins as you can. Go fast: every second or so you lose a coin you've already picked up because, you know, it costs money to be alive. It's a metaphor for the rat race or something.

One playable level is in the game, several more are *in my head*.
