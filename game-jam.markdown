From June 14-June 28 2022, I'm participating in the [Ebitengine Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/ebiten-game-jam). I wanted to try building something end-to-end in two weeks. The theme is "magnet ðŸ§²".

This little game currently has no title. It's going to be a [sokoban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban)-like puzzle game, where you move magnetic pieces (the grey rounded rectangles) in order to collect little brightly-colored gems within a limited number of moves. 

Press arrow keys to pulse an electromagnet on the corresponding edge of the board: all the magnetic pieces will move one cell in the direction of that magnet if they are able, pushing any moveable pieces along the way. The "magneticism" theme will be a little more clear once I add some animation.
