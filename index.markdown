:wave: This is me: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/JulesGraybill), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jules-graybill/), [GitHub](https://github.com/jcgraybill).  Things I've worked on lately include:

### ❤️ attraction
A contribution to the first [ebitengine game jam](https://itch.io/jam/ebiten-game-jam), built over two weeks in June 2022. It's a tile-and-grid puzzle game, with a theme of magnets and attraction, and a tribute to Pride Month. [Source code](https://github.com/jcgraybill/attraction) on GitHub. [Play it on itch.io](https://ivlivs.itch.io/attraction).

### ship-shape
A supply chain management indie game ... IN SPACE! Built in [golang](https://go.dev/) using the [ebitengine](https://ebiten.org/) 2D game library and [gg](https://github.com/fogleman/gg) 2D graphics library. [Source code](https://github.com/jcgraybill/it-costs-money) on GitHub. [Play it in your browser](/ship-shape/).


### it costs money to be alive
A short, simple, non-fighty side scroller indie game. Built in [golang](https://go.dev/) using the [ebitengine](https://ebiten.org/) 2D game library. [Source code](https://github.com/jcgraybill/ship-shape) on GitHub. [Play it in your browser](/it-costs-money/).


### OpenSearch
When I was at AWS, I was responsible for [OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/), a community-driven, open source search and analytics suite derived from the open source Elasticsearch & Kibana codebases. I'm no longer involved with OpenSearch, but both it and Elasticsearch are great software. Use them! [Source code](https://github.com/opensearch-project) on GitHub.

Check your [`vm.max_map_count`](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/opensearch/install/important-settings/) then...
