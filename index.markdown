:wave: This is me: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/JulesGraybill), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jules-graybill/), [GitHub](https://github.com/jcgraybill).  Things I've worked on lately include:

### ship-shape
:rocket: A supply chain management indie game ... IN SPACE! Built in [golang](https://go.dev/) using the [ebiten](https://ebiten.org/) 2D game library and [gg](https://github.com/fogleman/gg) 2D graphics library. [Source code](https://github.com/jcgraybill/it-costs-money) on GitHub.

**Play ship-shape** [:arrow_right:](/ship-shape/)

### it costs money to be alive

### OpenSearch
:mag: I led the project to create [OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/), a community-driven, open source search and analytics suite derived from Apache 2.0 licensed Elasticsearch 7.10.2 & Kibana 7.10.2. I'm no longer involved with OpenSearch, but both it and Elasticsearch are great software. Use them! [Source code](https://github.com/opensearch-project) on GitHub.

**Try OpenSearch**

Check your [`vm.max_map_count`](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/opensearch/install/important-settings/) then...

    curl -O https://opensearch.org/samples/docker-compose.yml
    docker-compose up
    curl -k https://admin:admin@localhost:9200/
