:wave: This is me: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/JulesGraybill), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jules-graybill/), [GitHub](https://github.com/jcgraybill).  Some things I've done:

### OpenSearch
At AWS, I was in charge of [OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/), an open source fork of [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/). I'm no longer involved with OpenSearch, but both it and Elasticsearch are great software.

Try it out! Check your [`vm.max_map_count`](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/opensearch/install/important-settings/) then...

    curl -O https://opensearch.org/samples/docker-compose.yml
    docker-compose up
    curl -k https://admin:admin@localhost:9200/

### Ebitengine games
I've been writing 2D videogames using [Hajime Hoshi](https://hajimehoshi.com/)'s excellent [Ebitengine](https://ebiten.org/) game library, to scratch my programming itch when I'm not building software at work. They're all various levels of complete. Here are a few that are playable and even a little fun. Enjoy!
* **❤️ attraction**: A tile-and-grid puzzle game built for the [ebitengine game jam](https://itch.io/jam/ebiten-game-jam). [Play it on itch.io](https://ivlivs.itch.io/attraction).
* **ship-shape**:  Supply chain management... *in space!* [Play it in your browser](/ship-shape/).
* **it costs money to be alive**: A short, simple side scroller. [Play it in your browser](/it-costs-money/).
